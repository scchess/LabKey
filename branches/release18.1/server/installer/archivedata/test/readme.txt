In this directory are a number of scripts that will allow you to easily setup a server to test the upgrade.sh script on. 
The scripts allow you to test the following distributions 
	- Fedora 14+
	- CentOS 5.4+ 
	- Debian 

The scripts assume that 
1) you can start a cloud server (LabKey has accounts with Rackspace and Amazon's EC2) running 
	one of these distributions. 
2) A file backup and database backup are available via the 10.3 directory in 
	https://www.labkey.org/project/Internal/Staff/bconn/testing/begin.view?
3) The labkey.org account for lkreader@labkey.com is functional and you know the password 
	(See Brian for this information)

To use one of these scripts to test the Linux upgrade script for LabKey server, simply choose the distribution you would like to test and follow the instructions.
