<h2>WNPRC MHC Haplotypes</h2>
<p>The major histocompatibility complex is one of the most complex and polymorphic regions of the genome. While there are hundreds of genes in the MHC, the WNPRC focuses on studying MHC class I genes that are fundamental to CD8+ T cell responses; these T cell responses are central to immunity to pathogens and tumor suppression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Macaques have two chromosomes, each of which encodes a collection of MHC class I genes. The number of genes varies per haplotype, but is generally on the order of 20. Of these, approximately half can be detected as RNA transcripts in peripheral blood cells. An even smaller number, termed 'major' transcripts, are abundant among the MHC class I RNAs. These 'major' transcripts are predominantly responsible for restricting CD8+ T cell responses (at least against simian immunodeficiency virus, where by far the greatest number of macaque CD8+ T cell responses have been characterized).&nbsp;</p>
<p>With so many MHC class I genes per chromosome, it is perhaps not surprising that more than 1,000 MHC class I gene variants, or alleles, have been defined in Indian rhesus macaques. Comparable numbers of alleles have been identified in cynomolgus macaques and in rhesus macaques of other origins. For a long time, this led us to believe that sorting out MHC class I genetics would be unfathomably complex.</p>
<p>Conventional genotyping tests, or assays that determine which MHC class I alleles an animal possesses, have not even tried to understand this complexity. In the most common tests, termed PCR-SSP assays, animals are tested for the presence or absence of 8 MHC class I alleles important to SIV immunity. More recently, our group has performed deep sequencing on MHC class I alleles from a large number of macaques. To our surprise, we discovered that the majority of MHC class I chromosomes follow simple and predictable arrangements. The MHC class I region is subdivided further into MHC class I A and class I B genes; there are simple groups of MHC class I A and B alleles that are consistently inherited together as haplotypes.</p>
<p>We have derived descriptive names for these haplotypes that are based on the most 'major' MHC class I transcript it encodes. For example, the A001 haplotype encodes a set of alleles including Mamu-A1*001, an allele that is transcriptionally abundant and known to be involved in SIV immunity. Looking at an animal's haplotypes allows you to discover, at a glance, up to four MHC class I alleles that are potentially restricting CD8+ T cell responses (two MHC class I A and two MHC class I B haplotypes). We also have generated a dictionary that comprehensively lists all of the major and minor MHC class I transcripts associated with each haplotype.</p>
