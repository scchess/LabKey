syncp-locks directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the lock files for the perls script syncp.pl,
a script for synchronously copying files from shared storage to cluster
nodes.  This helps avoid the problem of dozens of cluster nodes trying
to copy files from the same directory at once.

---------------------------------
Notes
---------------------------------
1. syncp.pl is written to create the files it needs.
2. If, however, multiple users are going to use syncp.pl, then:
	- all users must have write access to the 'counter' file.
	- all users must have read access to the 'lock#' files.
