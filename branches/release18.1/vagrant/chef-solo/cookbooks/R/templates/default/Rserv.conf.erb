# Normally, the Rserver changes to an unprivileged user on startup. The
# password file would need to readable by this user. As client code also runs
# as the unprivileged user, it could also read the password file, or otherwise
# affect the listening service.
#
# Using the "su client" option, the Rserver runs as root, but when a client
# connects, the client connection handler process reads the password file,
# validates the user, and then changes to the unprivileged user. This
# configuration prevents a client from affecting the listening server or
# reading the password file.
#
# Note that the "su" option must appear before the "gid" and "uid" options,
# otherwise the Rserver changes as soon as it reads the "gid" and "uid" options.
