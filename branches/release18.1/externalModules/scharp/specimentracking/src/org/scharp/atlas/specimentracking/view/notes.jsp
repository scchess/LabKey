    This tool is used by end user labs to reconcile each electronic manifest received from the repositories with the content of
    the box containing the specimens. Once the contents of the box are reconciled with the manifest, the data is stored in the
    CHAVI specimentracking database, to provide full chain of custody for the specimens.
    <br><br>
    The screen above displays every manifest uploaded by the user. Only 'LabWare'-style manifests may be uploaded to the portal.
    These are comma-delimited files of form aaa-bbb-xxxxxxxxx.csv, where aaa is the sending lab, bbb is the receiving lab, and xxxxxxxxx
    indicates the shipment number from the shipping lab.
    <br><br>
    Click on 'Upload Manifest' to browse to a new manifest. Each manifest may be uploaded only once. Clicking on [Details] for a specific manifest
    reveals the current status of the reconciliation.
    <br>
    Per CHAVI SOP S0002, end user labs using LDMS or the HVTN implementation of LabWare do not need to use this tool.<br>
    All other CHAVI end user labs should use this tool to confirm receipt of specimens.
